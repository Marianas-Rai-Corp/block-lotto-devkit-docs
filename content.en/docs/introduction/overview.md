# Overview

This web application is a **Bitcoin Based Lottery** platform that allows users to participate in a lottery using their token as their ticket of entry.

The token uses the [Simple Ledger Protocol](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-specifications/blob/master/slp-payment-protocol.md), a battle-tested token protocol supported by wallets on millions of devices, leveraging all open protocols, so anyone can develop applications that support the token. Every transaction is an eCash transaction, and leverages Bitcoin's ultra-secure technology.

The seller of the digital good in this transaction is [Marianas Rai Corp.](https://nmrai.com), the official licensed operator of the lottery.

The purchase is for a lottery ticket only. It is not a purchase of digital currency, credits on any third-party platform, or any other product or service.

Once purchased, the data comprising the lottery ticket will be stored, as a transaction, on the eCash (XEC) blockchain. When the ticket transaction is confirmed in a block, this unhosted and non-custodial wallet will independently use the lottery ticket data to perform ticket redemption and (if applicable) payout of credits.

## Advantages

There are several crucial advantages over tokens as you have known them.

1. **Self Minted**: There is no need to buy or sell tickets. You mint and burn the tickets right in your own wallet.
2. **Built on Bitcoin**: Each transaction has the same security and functionality as any other transaction on eCash, a fork of Bitcoin.
3. **Safe and Simple**: We utilize the Simple Ledger Protocol, so there are no buggy smart contracts or complicated wallet installations needed to send and receive tokens.
4. **Customer Service**: Mint and burn problems can be easily rectified due to our unique self-mint protocol.
