# Overview

The Marianas Blockchain Lottery is running on a provably fair, [Bitcoin-based Protocol](https://github.com/badger-cash/block-lotto-specification).

Marianas Rai Corp. provides an open-source React module, [blocklotto-sdk](), that allows creators to build new skins around it.

In the lottery, a user buys tickets which are broadcasted to the eCash blockchain, a fork of Bitcoin. With the confirmation of this transaction, multiple random numbers are created and used to calculate the user's winning tier. The winning payouts use an [Simple Ledger Protocol Token Type 2](https://github.com/badger-cash/slp-specifications/blob/master/slp-token-type-2.md), leveraging Bitcoin's ultra-secure technology. Multiple options exist to cash out the token winnings.

The seller of the digital good in this transaction is [Marianas Rai Corp.](https://nmrai.com), the official licensed operator of the lottery.

The purchase is for a lottery ticket only. It is not a purchase of digital currency, credits on any third-party platform, or any other product or service.
